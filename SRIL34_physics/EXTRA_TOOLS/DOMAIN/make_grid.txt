#INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO CREATE COORODINATES AND BATHYMETRY USING GRIDBUILDER

#--INSTALLS ON MATLAB----

#Note this is done on livljobs8

#Download GridBuilder 

wget https://austides.com/wp-content/uploads/GridBuilder_toolbox.mltbx

#Open matlab:

module load matlab
matlab

#When in matlab, click on 
GridBuilder_toolbox.mltbx to install 

#Check Add-Ons location in Preferences:
~/Documents/MATLAB/Add-Ons/Toolboxes/

#Add a trick to allow Gridbuilder to read *.nc files:

cp getUserBathymetry.m ~/Documents/MATAB/Add-Ons/Toolboxes/Gridbuilder/Functions/

Change paths in environment.m and run

---------------------

In matlab type:

GridBuilder

This will open up the Gridbuilder GUI

Go to File --> Import --> Bathymetry --> *your bathymetry file* (in my case, its LME_32_34_GEBCO_bathy.nc)  

Draw your grid on the map, starting from the bottom left-hand corner (more stable this way)

Change the resolution of your grid in the box at the top

You can rotate the grid using the "Grid Edit" tools on the right hand side of the GUI

When happy with your grid, go to Mask Settings and choose GSHHC Coastlines (this takes a while so should be your last step) 

Save your grid using a unique identifier e.g. SRIL34_Grid.mat (SRIL34 stands for Sri Lanka in LME number 34) 

------------------

Now that you have your grid, open GridBuilder_to_NEMO.m

Change the grid_path to reflect the location of your saved grid file 
Change the domain paths to reflect your directories (note the assessment path is not called in this script)

DOMNAM is the unique identifier you used (e.g. SRIL34) 

Run the script

This should spit out your chosen grid in NEMO compatable files: 

SRIL34_bathy_meter.nc 
SRIL34_coordinates.nc 

This files will then be used to create the domain_cfg.nc file
